# Custom-Client-LESS-Files
This is a list of custom client LESS files so the client team can access them

## NOTE: This list might get out of sync with what's actually uploaded to the S3 bucket.
To ensure this list is up-to-date you can run the update.sh script to pull all client files down.

Likewise, any changes here will NOT automatically update the S3 bucketâ€”meaning they will not be live for the client! You'll need to manually post to the `/css` endpoint in order to upload the LESS file with any changes. In general, if you make a commit here with some changes, you should also post it to the endpoint. See the curl request below for an example:

```
curl --request POST 'https://watershedlrs.com/api/organizations/<org_id>/css' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic username:password' \
--form 'file=@/File/path/to/your/LESS/file/1391_rebrand_prod.less'
```
